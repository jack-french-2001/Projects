For this project, a group composed of four other MSci Data Science students and I were tasked with creating a flight tracking data visualisation dashboard. 

Our client was a group of researchers at the University of Exeter who are aiming to replace the work that air traffic controllers perform with Artificial Intelligence technology. 

Through access to flight tracking data made available by NATS (National Air Traffic Services) Holdings, a company which provides air traffic control services to flights within the United Kingdomâ€™s airspace as well as air control services to multiple UK airports, our client seeks to ascertain the feasibility of emulating the functions carried out by air traffic controllers through the application of Artificial Intelligence technologies. In order to aid them in this project, they explained to us that they would like to have access to an interactive data-driven dashboard visualizing historical flight tracking data. This dashboard would be powered by historical flight tracking data provided by NATS Holdings, whose main component would be a 2-dimensional interactive map of the United Kingdom on which an interactive animated scatter plot has been superimposed, displaying the movement of aircrafts in UK airspace over time.

There are multiple filtering operations which can be performed and a heatmap can be superimposed on the scatter plot in order to visualise hotspots.

This dashboard was produced in Python using the Bokeh visualisation package. 

### Dashboard Demonstration

For confidentiality purposes I am not able to publish the code or data used to make the dashboard. However, here is a link to a demonstration of the dashboard's functionalities:
